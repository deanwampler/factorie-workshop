good news regarding the ena leadership curriculum ! through the help of a
vendor selection team from eops , we ' ve chosen southwest performance group and
wilson learning products as one of our primary vendors for the leadership
curriculum and programs . we are ready to conduct a pilot on february 8 - 10 of
six modules . the purpose of the pilot is to evaluate for fine - tuning the
wilson learning materials and facilitators and to present just a portion of
the leadership curriculum .
in order to evaluate the materials thoroughly , it would be great to get a
cross - section of ena to attend . we are asking that you invite several
supervisors from your client groups to participate in any of the courses
listed below . the sessions will be held in room 560 and times are listed
below . also attached is a description of the modules . all are designed for
supervisors only , with the exception being " communicating effectively " . this
is open to any employee . as a benefit in attending the pilot , i will pick up
the cost . , so there will be no charge back for their attendance .
we are currently completing the curriculum design and will have information
on the full curriculum available in february . this will include options
other than " classrom setting " for development .
please respond back to gracie presas by february 1 with your names . if you
have further questions , please contact me at 3 - 7394 . we are really excited
that we have this available and hope that your clients will find it to be
valuable .
the following are half - day sessions . supervisors may sign up for any or all
depending on their need . it would be helpful if supervisors attend a minimum
of two modules .

please contact kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) or robert johnston ( x 39934 ) for further clarification .
executive summary :
utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles - agreement on payback for the bailout , rate increases , and further short - term funding for dwr purchases of power .
disagreement persists between gov . davis and democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities . the split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets .
the economics of the long - term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period .
air quality management district regulations are under review , but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity .
legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left - wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow , if not stop , davis ' s bailout and rate hike plans . senator burton ' s eminent domain threats against generators , which reflect this pressure , are of little significance .
1 . bankruptcy outlook rising once again
a deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state , the utilities , and their creditors , with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on tuesday .
socal edison and pg & e are not paying any of their bills except for payroll . they are working very hard to keep cash on - hand , and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing . once this filing occurs , they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy .
opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy . assemblyman keeley told our source that a filing is likely , but that everything will be resolved during that 50 - day period . senator john burton " is in no hurry " to reach a deal with the utilities , as he believes that the state of california is in a good position to " strong - arm " the utilities . burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy . the senator stated , " bankruptcy would be bad , but not the worst thing possible . " he intends to stick to his position . senator burton also dismissed governor davis ' end - of - week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities .
still , bankruptcy can be avoided if a last - minute deal can be struck monday on :
what the state receives in return for the bailout
the scope of rate hikes ( a federal court is expected to rule on the pg & e / socal v . cpuc rate undercollection case monday )
additional financing is made available to the dwr to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in may .
there is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance . however , the negative tone taken by standard & poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve . the previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high - level washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend .
additional financing for dwr will not be automatically approved by the legislature . the non - energy expenditures of the california government are now at risk , as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the general fund .
2 . state to take 2 / 3 of utility debt
while the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the $ 12 billion debt , a final deal has been held up on two fronts . first , it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt . it is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and / or transmission assets . a takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets . the value of these assets still has not been settled . second , while the state will be on the hook for $ 9 billion , it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout . finally , expect davis and other california politicians to work to minimize rate hikes ( although the edison / pg & e v . cpuc case on monday is likely to force their hand here ) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout . the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants .
no price has been set at which the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets , which are currently valued at approximately $ 7 - $ 8 billion . all of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities ' debts , as some of the money would go to existing bondholders . however , ipp sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer .
3 . long - term contracts
as noted by the governor in his announcement tuesday , only 500 mw of the 5 , 000 mw of power contracted for can come on - line immediately . much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long - term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants . some of this will come on - line in approximately two years .
assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that he has received a " tablet from on high " from governor davis that there must not be a rate increase . this means that the state must acquire power , not from internal sources or from the market , but through long - term contracts at 7 . 39 cents / kwh . this allows 1 . 213 cents to amortize socal edison ' s undercollection from the recent rate freeze period . ( the number is slightly different for pg & e . ) this assumption is based on a natural gas price of $ 7 . 90 in 2001 and $ 5 . 15 in 2005 , and an efficiency heating rate of 10 , 000 - 12 , 000 in 2001 and 7 , 200 in 2005 .
these numbers were quoted to industry sources , who felt they were unrealistic . these sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as $ 9 . 00 - $ 9 . 50 . the sources agreed with keeley ' s number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate , but they felt that 7 , 200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line .
according to keeley ' s numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at $ 7 billion rather than $ 12 billion , it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection . a settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the state can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection . however , since assemblyman keeley ' s numbers are unrealistic , a rate increase will be necessary .
4 . air quality district exemptions
there have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from aqmd ( air quality management district ) regulations - - ab 20 x , ab 28 x , ab 31 x . also , republicans have been asking the governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in san jose that was denied by the local government .
currently there is no contemplation of loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions . the legislature will not allow " dirtier " plants to
come on - line . however , there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern california by moving away from the
use of credits ( this apparently drives up the cost of gas - fired power ) .
5 . democratic moderates pressured by consumer advocates
the moderate left ( sen . burton , the puc , consumer activists ) is afraid of harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement . this is not just because of his initiative . more important from their perspective , his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election . thus , democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout .
6 . eminent domain would have a limited effect
the threats by burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited . they only apply to california suppliers . a
federal order would be needed to seize assets from out - of - state suppliers . there are also canadian suppliers ( such as bc hydro ) who are essentially untouchable .
7 . smaller ipps feeling the squeeze
many of the smaller ipps , which account for approximately 2500 mw of production , appear to be within a few days of running out of cash .
ab lx may be amended , possibly sometime this week , to give the smaller producers credit support .Subject: david gray

bankruptcy
early this week , there was a closed door meeting held by the western power trading forum in arizona . the meeting took place outside california to avoid press coverage and allow ipps to maintain a low profile . association representatives believe that regardless of what happens with the puc vs . utilities ruling expected on monday , some ipps will take the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy . our source expects that absent a significant last minute breakthrough , the filing will happen within the next two weeks , and " probably " next week . as stated in yesterdays report , the ipps are very low on cash and are not able to cover the debts of the pg & e and socal . only three creditors are needed with uncollected debts of more than $ 10 , 000 to file involuntary bankruptcy .
bail out
davis has been meeting with the chief executives of both utilities in a last ditch effort to make a deal prior to monday ' s court ruling . the most likely scenario is for state ownership of the utilities transmissions assets . however , coming to an agreed upon price will be very challenging . in addition , pg & e and edison appear to have competing agendas in pursuing a bail out plan . davis is expect to continue meetings through out the weekend in hopes of reaching an agreement before monday .Subject: urg : gas securitization agreements

louise , sorry , i just received your note .
the extent of any discussion was dave thanking me over the phone for the inputs and recognizing that he and john incorporated some of the content . we ' ve never had what i had been expecting , or at least presumed appropriate i . e . , prior to any formal decision for the region , entertaining an in - person detailed discussion of the examples and recommendations - including a welcome cross examination of my observations that might conflict with official report or view .
john and dave asked me to talk with brett , kish and gonzalez , but if you look at my recommendations and also consider the overall performance in the region does this make the best sense ? i ' ve done this again and , in fact , had already introduced my ideas to each of them and the previous system prior to forwarding them to houston .
prior to having to leave enron , i wanted to make a best effort to get the authority to execute the recommendations i ' ve pretty consistently introduced since joining in late 1998 and tried to get enron to implement under the previous management . i have not had the opportunity to manage or influence the company ' s operations in south america - this is my fault for not negotiating a more senior position , but i made the attempt in the region and more recently with the new managers to demonstrate a need to open constructive , critical discussion .
anyway , i ' ve tried to open the door to john , dave and you and others who are interested to brainstorm inlcuding the leadership in place in esa to understand and perhaps leverage my applied experience - both trading , origination and , importantly , cultural . my resume below should attest to my capabilities - at least in terms of the potential value of my observations .
thank you for your efforts extended in my behalf and good luck in your new position and working within enron ' s unique , dynamic ethic .

david / john - understand the trip will be delayed .
proposal outline has two texts - i . commercial strategy and ii . historical perspective . the org charts will need some discussion - particularly in regard to the strengths and weakness of employed personnel and urgent need for an improved structure .
over the fh 2000 and within the new structure with brett and joao carlos albuquerque in place , the wholesale group and trading desk seems to have made some important strides forward in terms of recruiting some good individuals and , in trading terms , finally executing some fundamental market supply , demand and transmission analysis .
to get into the game quickly and aggressively , though , i think the commercial group needs to hire some senior , local trading expertise . i apoligize , but was unable to get in contact with either of these two guys to set up a possible meeting this week . however , they have the local knowledge , trading competencies and management experience which i consider needed to catalyze the regional effort :
axel hinsch - argentine and cargill employee with several years and broad commodity and financial trading , business development and management experience , including senior trader for the bear stearns emerging markets equity desks in the late 1980 s / early 1990 s . straight up , no ego
argentine country manager .
mark hoffman - swiss / brazilian and glencore employee with several years energy , energy distribution and sugar sector experience ; applied commodity and financial arbitrage experience in the brazilian market . lot less straight forward , but applied knowledge and expertise .
senior originator / trader .
please forward any input about your interest in scheduling a meeting either open here or in houston during the week of nov 20 .
for some perspective on my experience at enron , let me explaing that i have been working in enron networks in the region from q 2 ' 00 and therefore much less formally invovled with the trading ( brazil spot market ) and wholesale pricing , tarrif issues etc . , . . than at the end of fyl 999 when i was directly involved in developing our effort to get in the game in understanding the spot price formula calculations and exploring arbitrage opportunities in the wholesale market .
i ' ve attached my resume for some perspective on my background and capability to critically review the commercial ( trading and marketing ) and managerial issues involving the past and future opportunities .

i ' ve attached my resume for some perspective on my background and capability to critically review the commercial ( trading and marketing ) and managerial issues involving the past and future opportunities .Subject: king ranch
there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify
system .
1 . cage ranch - since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this
gas on king ranch , it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and
king ranch is re - delivering to stratton . it is also my understanding that
there is a . 05 cent fee
to deliver this gas . we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl
at meter 415 and 9643 . this gas
will not be reflected on trans . usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is
not being nominated from a processing agreement . we either , need to input
a point nom ( on hpl or krgp ) at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610 ,
or a deal for purchase and sale ( if king ranch is taking title to the gas )
needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate . i
have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow , so we can
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made .
2 . forest oil - there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow
from the meter ( 6396 ) into king ranch . it is my
understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had
their own processing agreement . i need confirmation that the gas from this
meter should be nominated on contract # ( 96006681 ) and that this agreement
should have been reassigned to hplc . ( it is currently still under hplr ) .
if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once
again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a
point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 .Subject: re : entex transistion
thanks so much for the memo . i would like to reiterate my support on two key

the purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday
with members from commercial and volume managment concernig the entex account :
effective january 2000 , thu nguyen ( x 37159 ) in the volume managment group ,
will take over the responsibility of allocating the entex contracts . howard
and thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the
account over the next few months . entex will be thu ' s primary account
especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations
process and the contracts .
howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be
available for questions or as a backup , if necessary ( thanks howard for all
your hard work on the account this year ! ) .
in the initial phases of this transistion , i would like to organize an entex
" account " team . the team ( members from front office to back office ) would
meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the
scheduling , allocations , settlements , contracts , deals , etc . this hopefully
will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before
the finalization process , but to learn from each other relative to your
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as
well . i would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as i
believe this is a critical part to the success of the entex account .
i will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1 / 2000 .
if anyone has any questions or concerns , please feel free to call me or stop

2 : 00 pm est
beyond california : the power however , the
markets foretell stronger prices across the country in 2001 .
we continue to recommend the power producers , based on both our power price
and spark spread analyses , which show strengthening spark spreads in the
united states , despite the record highs recently seen in the natural gas
markets . we highlight calpine , nrg energy , and mirant .
our volatility indices demonstrate a dramatic shift in historical volatility
to the western hubs and away from the midwestern markets of 1998 - 99 . we
expect volatility to persist in the west , likely accompanied by higher
volatility in the remainder of the country in 2001 . this benefits energy
merchants , and we highlight enron , dynegy , duke , and el paso .

ray stellySubject: california update 2 / 12
executive summary :
the likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60 % . this is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below , but also because the 30 - day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week , increasing the likelihood that their ipp creditors will act against them . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) , this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly .
1 . utilities vs . cpuc
governor davis ' attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed . the case will come before the judge on monday , february 12 th . the federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities . however , the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ( $ . 01 / kwh ) . this will be left to an appellate court . the decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing , by the smaller ipps ( as noted in our reports last week ) or by larger out - of - state generators such as duke , reliant , and dynegy ( as noted in the press this morning ) . this is expected next week or the week after .
2 . prospects for a bailout
bill ab 18 x is effectively dead from lack of support .
senator burton , despite his public refusals , is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail - out . the statements by burton and the ca state treasurer are merely a negotiating position . they are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear . for burton , this is because of his long association with labor unions ; the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy .
burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate harvey rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him . the deal burton is expected to arrange would be for :
bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state , but with some kind of state support ( but less than " full faith and credit of the state of ca , " which would not pass ) . this would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills ( e . g . $ . 01 , though the actual amount is not known ) . these bonds would be asset - backed securities , with payment receivable from rate payers . the term of these bonds is unknown ; if the term is made quite long ( e . g . 20 years ) , the associated rate increase could be very small .
the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets for a very high price . the amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled .
if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) , sources believe that this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . as noted in an earlier report , the california legislature habitually does not act until things " hit the wall . "
it is expected that the republicans in the legislature will follow burton ' s lead and support the bail - out plan . the assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature . one moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail - out in her central valley district is " 50 to 1 . " however , an involuntary filing ( or the threat thereof ) may be enough to trigger legislative support . it would allow the argument of an " imminent threat " to the people of the state of california .
3 . consumer opposition
harvey rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum . if the referendum fails , he intends to attack individual legislators ( though not john burton , who reportedly has " immunity " from rosenfield ) .
some legislators are thinking of voting for the bail - out plan , then supporting a referendum from rosenfield later . however , if the bail - out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill ( rather than put in place by the puc , for example ) , it cannot be reversed by a referendum . as additional insurance against rosenfield , by supporting the bonds issued under the plan , the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan . while it is not clear that this is a factual argument , it still might impede any referendum .Subject: unify close schedule

for questions contact robert johnston at x 39934 .
court case denies rate hikes
as forecast in our report yesterday , the federal court in los angeles refused to allow the two california utilities to raise rates to recoup undercollections of their power costs since last august . we had expected that the court would rule in favor of the utilities , but push the rate hike question to an appeals court . instead , judge ronald lew refused to rule on the case because of technical considerations and postponed a hearing until march 5 th . the utilities now face an imminent end to creditor forbearance without the prospect of short - term rate hikes . edison reaches the end of its grace period for a $ 200 million payment today and a $ 600 million payment on thursday . absent the political cover of the court to impose rate hikes , the governor and the state legislature are in an equally tenuous position .
bankruptcy grows more likely
regardless of the legal technicalities , the bottom line is the same . as we have cautioned since last wednesday , there is a serious risk that a creditor or
group of creditors could push for bankruptcy , perhapsas soon as tomorrow when the period of forbearance agreed to by financial creditors runs out .
before this ruling , there was reasonable assurance that the utilities would be restored to health by their court victory . now there is real fear a coherent deal is
unravelling , and that it will not take much for a small group of financial creditors to break ranks . and the prospects for supplier creditors now look
much bleaker and more dangerous . and there is an increased temptation for the utilities to declare bankruptcy and take their chances with a judge rather
than the california assembly . the politicians will try to find a way to prevent bankruptcy , but it will now be difficult .
disarray in the legislature
for now , the only card still being played is the " i give you a dollar , you give me a hot dog " plan , as state senator burton accurately summed it up . the state
pumps money into the utilities in return for some kind of asset - - warrants , transmission lines , whatever , anything that can be brandished in front of the voters as
proof that the utilities suffered and paid . but " there is little or no energy among legislators for either of the proposed solutions , " one senior figure in sacramento
told our source yesterday afternoon . " legislators are running scared . and i don ' t know of a single legislator in either house , on either side , who has the slightest
sympathy for the utiltiies now . they think the utiltiies have either been incompetent or shrewd or both . " the ruling will in all likelihood send officials back to the
drawing board . " davis will propose a kind of shadow plan by friday , but there will be no real substance in it . what are we supposed to do in just four
days ? there will not be a real substantive plan for three weeks , i think , at the earliest . " that period of uncertainty and lack of energy in the legislature could
panic the creditors now .
bankruptcy court
if davis fails to cobble together a last - minute deal for rate hikes and some kind of purchase of transmission assets , then all parties will have to do a workout
in federal bankruptcy court . the most likely scenario ( which we flagged last week ) is that the small ipps file an involuntary bankruptcy against edison , followed
possibly by pg & e . involuntary bankruptcy would shield the utilities from creditor lawsuits and temporarily relieve them from debt payments . there is also
speculation in the press this morning that some creditors are talking about a ch . 7 or liquidation proceeding , but that cannot yet be confirmed by sources .Subject: wednesday enpower cleanup meeting 4 - 4 - 01

1 . we can detect " hoarding " of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against
the actual inflow .
2 . we can detect " market power " by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,
distinguishing between the physical " cost " in gas to run the generators and
the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .
3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect " storage " as the difference between inflow
and consumption .
it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model
of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market
prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing
capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas
prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for
the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :
hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can " calibrate " the
price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price
elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,
from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis
trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage
and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and
each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,
flows are " explained " by the model , and can be imputed from prices if
necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of
the weather .
i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a
model .

with respect to your questions concerning the heartland industrial partners fund and current investments :
heartland is a private equity buyout fund with $ 1 . 2 billion in commitments . the targeted size of the fund is $ 2 billion . the fund is headed by david stockman , former managing director at the blackstone group . stockman was director of omb under reagan .
heartland ' s objective is an irr of 30 % gross ( 26 % to the limited partners ) . the limiteds get an 8 % preferred return after which the gp gets a 20 % carried return . the gp also receives a 1 . 5 % management fee . in my experience these terms are consistent with most private equity funds .
the fund ' s objective is to acquire and expand industrial companies " in sectors ripe for consolidation and growth . " these " industrial platform scaleups " are targeted to be in sectors such as aerospace components and materials , automotive suppliers , capital goods , chemicals , plastics conversion , metal working , etc .
the fund has two investments currently :
mascotech is a merger of three fund companies . it is a leading global designer and supplier of high quality , low - cost metal formed components , assemblies and modules for the transportation industry . products include noise vibration and harshness products , transmission and transfer case components , engine components , wheel end and suspension components , axle driveline components . estimated revenues were $ 1 . 9 billion in 2001 . the company has 50 facilities in 11 countries . 9 , 500 employees .
an agreement to purchase collins & aikman corporation was signed in january 2001 . c & a is a leader in automotive floor and acoustic ceilings and a leading supplier of automotive fabric , interior trim and convertible top systems with 2000 sales of $ 1 . 9 billion .
the original dash in april 2000 predicated that " ena will receive the exclusive right to provide all energy - related products and services to each platform company owned by the fund . . . ena will submit a comprehensive , long - term , energy managment plan for each platform company . hip will be obligated to accept and implement the plan as long as the plan provides a cost benefit relative to the platform company ' s current practices after accounting for switching costs . the expected value of this business to ena is about $ 20 - 50 mm .

dave ,
congrats on your new role . heartland industrial partners was an investment pursued solely for the purpose of providing deal flow for energy outsourcing opportunities when ena ' s industrial group was following a broad based energy outsourcing business plan . it has zero relevance to eim ' s business . in fact , heartland has been reflected on ena ' s balance sheet ever since the creation of eim last august . brad dunn has administered the relationship as a transitional matter in the intervening months . brad has attempted to get ees to take on the transaction , but they have expressed no interest in the capital commitment . however , ees wants the option to look at the energy outsourcing opportunities in the transaction . if i thought i could get a free option , i would take the same position . if enron is to get anything out of heartland industrial partners beyond the return on our invested dollars , that value will come to ees . since there is no paper or steel aspect to heartland , it doesn ' t belong in eim and i don ' t want it . i would be happy to discuss .
on a different note , there are lots of opportunities for ees and eim to work together on ( i ) energy opportunities in eim ' s pulp colwell , wes ; raymond bowen / hou / ect @ enron
subject : heartland industrial partners
richard , it is my understanding that this investment is currently in ray bowen ' s business . in my ena shoes , i would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility . in my ees shoes , i would like to take a closer look at the possible connections . please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio .
i have also heard that tom white has been talking to you about ees taking on the catalytica investment . with my ees shoes on , no way ! ! ! !

dave , in may 2000 enron north america committed to invest up to $ 30 million in heartland industrial partners l . p . , a private equity fund . the terms of the fund investment are fairly typical ( and not particularly exciting for a limited partner such as we ) . the deal was " sold " on the basis of ena getting exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies owned by the fund if these were cost effective . the claimed benefits for the energy management tie were calculated at $ 20 - 50 million . the deal was originated by brad dunn who now is in eim . ownership of this commitment had been assigned to jim ajello .
the kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now provided by ees . while they are happy to exploit any opportunity , their business plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this kind of deal . in short , they have no interest in picking up the commitment ( and capital employed ) via an intercompany transfer .
private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the normal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years . the heartland partnership has a 10 - year life , enron did negotiate the right to sell its lp interest after 3 years . as a practical matter , that right guarantees neither a fair price or even a market .
there is no logical home for this investment that i know of in ena except in my portfolio . question : is this an ena responsibility or would it move to eim ' s balance sheet ? if we ( ena ) have no choice but to retain the investment , my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to monetize funds invested to - date ( about $ 6 million ) and sell the remaining commitment . since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership interests , however , it will be extremely difficult to get out of our investment / commitment in the foreseeable future . under any circumstances finding a buyer will be time - consuming and expensive . ( this is a poster child for " patient " investment capital ) .
i want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is that the obligation should be transferred to eim which i believe has assumed the charter of the ena group that formerly managed this investment . dick .
Subject: organizational changes
to : enron north america corp .
from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon
in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the
continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our
people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,
and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both
within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the
corporate goal of fostering 
b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers
including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and
mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,
textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream
coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .
downstream coverage / origination
as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both
ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron
corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function
will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy
commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities
but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,
plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels
groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper
will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s
leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three
sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :
a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage
activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for
the provision of innovative
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision
of paper risk management products ;
b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to
lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the
chemicals and refined products industries ;
c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers
trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the
coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,
heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles
and glass manufacturing industries .
midstream coverage / origination
a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on
energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas
utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern
interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this
group ;
b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on
energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas
utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they
will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring
opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the
leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from
calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;
c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on
the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant
power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked
mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will
continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern
interconnect ;
d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring
opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing
restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have
asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,
formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of
citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join
this newly formed business .
2 ) commercial transactions :
the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff
donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of
transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing
transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity
of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction
development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity
structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical
analysis and upstream asset management .
the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction
with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service
and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :
a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and
western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group
include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy
lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of
capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today
from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power
origination .
b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial
origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,
environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is
established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay
boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .
c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant
services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior
members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and
john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the
vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few
weeks .
d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer
finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include
brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition
of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .
ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and
downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary
responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will
continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior
commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual
responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the
capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain
largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction
development teams and their respective origination groups will be located
together .
we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage
and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial
markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between
the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .
please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north
america by working with us to implement these changes .Subject: re : lyondell citgo

hcSubject: performance management process
as our existing businesses grow and new businesses are created , ease of
movement and development of our top talent becomes essential to our success .
as you heard at the management conference all officers will be titled ,
reviewed , promoted , and compensated according to a more standard set of
guidelines . the process recognizes the intrinsic value of each officer ,
rather than tying that individual to the value of their specific job or
reporting relationship .
officer titling has been standardized throughout enron . there are four
levels of officers : members of the enron office of the chairman make up level
4 . level 3 includes all other members of the enron executive committee .
level 2 is made up of managing directors , including company presidents and
some senior vice presidents . level 1 are vice presidents and some senior
vice presidents with grandfathered titles .
this year a common evaluation process is being implemented for level 1 and
level 2 officers . officers will be evaluated by a committee , through a
process referred to as the performance review committee ( prc ) , utilizing a
standard set of performance criteria and performance ratings . performance
committee reviews will occur twice a year  ) in july for feedback purposes and
at year - end for feedback as well as bonus and total compensation
considerations . the executive committee will handle the prc for all level 2
officers . review of level 1 officers will occur at the business - unit level
first with the results  & cross calibrated  8 by the executive committee and a
group of approximately sixteen managing directors .
the goals of the prc process is to insure a consistent standard for our
overall pool of executive talent and to provide a tool to more effectively
utilize talent throughout the organization . to further promote consistency
the executive committee will consider all promotions in january of each
year . exceptions , internally or externally , will be infrequent .
the individual  , s performance evaluation will be the starting point for all
compensation decisions . compensation includes base pay , bonus and long - term
awards . a long - term program that replaces individual or business unit plans
has been approved and will be communicated to individuals before bonus
payments are made .
in addition to the level 1 and level 2 reviews , business unit , global and
corporate cross - functional prc reviews for directors , senior directors and
general managers have started . this year - end process will be utilized as a
benchmark to determine how we further refine the evaluation process at this
level in the future .

subject : intelligence : el paso capacity - - someone has upped the ante but match
still possible
negotiated el paso deal topped
el paso confirmed that someone had upped the ante on the negotiated deal
for slightly
more than 1 . 2 bcf / d in firm capacity to the california border that was
announced friday
( see daily gpi , dec . 13 ) . a higher bid was submitted prior to
wednesday ' s 1 p . m . mst
deadline in a four - day open season , a pipeline spokesman said . however ,
the original
negotiating party has until this afternoon to match the new price and
retain the capacity .
the new bid was for $ 38 million over one year starting jan . 1 , about $ 8
million more than
the amount in friday ' s announcement ( $ 30 million ) . one source called it
" ridiculous " that
someone was willing to pay so much for the space , given that on a
mark - to - market basis
the capacity is worth only about $ 20 - 25 million .
late last week some sources speculated that duke energy was the
recipient of next
year ' s package given its large power generation holdings in california .
a marketer
yesterday said he believed dynegy upped the ante . " rather than go
through all the
hassles they [ dynegy ] had at ferc with the 1998 - 99 package , they let
someone else do
all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid . that way
no one can
complain that the procedure was tainted . after all , dynegy has quite a
few power plants
in california to keep fueled , and all of their current ft on el paso
expires at the end of
this year . of course , they still could be thwarted if the original
negotiated customer
matches their bid . it may all sound kind of machiavellian but sort of
makes sense . " other
sources heavily discounted the chances of dynegy being the new high
bidder , pointing out
that the company made significantly less than expected this year because
san
juan / border basis differentials narrowed significantly . a dynegy source
indicated that the
company was involved in the bidding and lost to duke in the first round .
regardless of what happens next year , a marketer noted that the southern
california
border / san juan basis spread continues to compress as socal gas
withdraws from
storage and east - of - california utilities exercise their peaking
contracts because of cold
weather in the rockies and elsewhere in the west . from a december index
spread of 29
cents , the border / basin gap was down to about 18 cents wednesday , she
said .Subject: january spot tickets

thanks !
- graceSubject: vince and vasant :
here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany , capacity trader at
the east desk , related to gas transmission :
typically , pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis . an example
might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn , where you might pay
$ 12 . 00 per month per 10 , 000 decatherms of capacity ( $ 0 . 40 per day ) , a fixed
payment . variable charges are 6 % for fuel costs ( " shrinkage " ) and 6 . 5 % for
overhead expenses . a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of nymex - $ 0 . 10 ( " basis " ) , and might call brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of nymex + $ 0 . 25 . the trader ' s spread is
$ 0 . 35 , and variable costs of transmission are $ 0 . 125 , so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $ 0 . 225 for firm capacity tomorrow .
as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible , the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm - equivalent of interruptible capacity .
also , many pipelines don ' t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
( " it ' s not worth their time to haggle " ) ( there is a further issue of
" secondary markets " not important to the model yet ) . for south texas and
brooklyn , there are several different routes the gas can physically take
( pipelines of enron , texas eastern , etc ) . and , once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the ( enron ) positions on each end of the pipeline ,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts .

sorry i ' m just now getting back to you . here are some answers to your
questions .
waskom is a field in east texas ( harrison county ) where we purchase gas from
pennzenergy at the bryson c . p . and jeter # 2 wells . the gas is termed up to
new
waskom gas gathering ( nwgg ) through june 2001 ( the term of the pennzenergy
purchase ) . we then buy the gas back from nwgg into our tetco east texas pool
. . . also termed up through 6 / 01 .
virginia field used to be associated with ngpl , but several years ago
pennzenergy worked out a processing arrangement with corpus christi gas
gathering , so the gas is now termed up with ccgm through 6 / 01 . . . priced off
of
the houston ship channel .
jennings ranch used to flow into ngpl through a gathering line , but a couple
of
years ago ngpl sold that line to midcon texas , so we now handle it as another
midcon texas property . sometimes we sell it at the meter to midcon texas
( kn ) ,
and sometimes we ship it through midcon to our ngpl south texas pool .
carthage : altra picks up their gas in their cartwheel agreement . the
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement . it is not much
different than a hub agreement , except it allows title tracking . tgt on the
whiteboard refers to texas gas . . . east ohio takes their gas into texas gas on
a couple of different transport contracts .
let me know if you have more questions .
