human growth hormone - also called hgh
is referred to in medical science as the master hormone . it is very plentiful
when we are young , but near the age of twenty - one our bodies begin to produce
less of it . by the time we are forty nearly everyone is deficient in hgh ,
and at eighty our production has normally diminished at least 90 - 95 % .
advantages of hgh :
- increased muscle strength
- loss in body fat
- increased bone density
- lower blood pressure
- quickens wound healing
- reduces cellulite
- improved vision
- wrinkle disappearance
- increased skin thickness texture

the rest of the afternoon was spent in making up the train . i am afraid to say how many baggage - waggons followed the engine , certainly a score ; then came the chinese , then we , then the families , and the rear was brought up by the conductor in what , if i have it rightly , is called his caboose . the class to which i belonged was of course far the largest , and we ran over , so to speak , to both sides ; so that there were some caucasians among the chinamen , and some bachelors among the families . but our own car was pure from admixture , save for one little boy of eight or nine who had the whooping - cough . at last , about six , the long train crawled out of the transfer station and across the wide missouri river to omaha , westward bound . it was a troubled uncomfortable evening in the cars . there was thunder in the air , which helped to keep us restless . a man played many airs upon the cornet , and none of them were much attended to , until he came to " home , sweet home . " it was truly strange to note how the talk ceased at that , and the faces began to lengthen . i have no idea whether musically this air is to be considered good or bad ; but it belongs to that class of art which may be best described as a brutal assault upon the feelings . pathos must be relieved by dignity of treatment . if you wallow naked in the pathetic , like the author of " home , sweet home , " you make your hearers weep in an unmanly fashion ; and even while yet they are moved , they despise themselves and hate the occasion of their weakness . it did not come to tears that night , for the experiment was interrupted . an elderly , hard - looking man , with a goatee beard and about as much appearance of sentiment an you would expect from a retired slaver , turned with a start and bade the performer stop that " damned thing . " " i ' ve heard about enough of that , " he added ; " give us something about the good country we ' re going to . " a murmur of adhesion ran round the car ; the performer took the instrument from his lips , laughed and nodded , and then struck into a dancing measure ; and , like a new timotheus , stilled immediately the emotion he had raised .

the day faded ; the lamps were lit ; a party of ht ht men , who got off next evening at north platte , stood together on the stern platform , singing " the sweet by - and - bye " with very tuneful voices ; the chums began to put up their beds ; and it seemed as if the business of the day were at an end . but it was not so ; for , the train stopping at some station , the cars were instantly thronged with the natives , wives and fathers , ht men and maidens , some of them in little more than nightgear , some with stable lanterns , and all offering beds for sale . their charge began with twenty - five cents a cushion , but fell , before the train went on again , to fifteen , with the bed - board gratis , or less than one - fifth of what i had paid for mine at the transfer . this is my contribution to the economy of future emigrants .
a great personage on an american train is the newsboy . he sells books ( such books ! ) , papers , fruit , lollipops , and cigars ; and on emigrant journeys , soap , towels , tin washing dishes , tin coffee pitchers , coffee , tea , sugar , and tinned eatables , mostly hash or beans and bacon . early next morning the newsboy went around the cars , and chumming on a more extended principle became the order of the hour . it requires but a copartnery of two to manage beds ; but washing and eating can be carried on most economically by a syndicate of three . i myself entered a little after sunrise into articles of agreement , and became one of the firm of pennsylvania , shakespeare , and dubuque . shakespeare was my own nickname on the cars ; pennsylvania that of my bedfellow ; and dubuque , the name of a place in the state of iowa , that of an amiable ht fellow going west to cure an asthma , and retarding his recovery by incessantly chewing or smoking , and sometimes chewing and smoking together . i have never seen tobacco so sillily abused . shakespeare bought a tin washing - dish , dubuque a towel , and pennsylvania a brick of soap . the partners used these instruments , one after another , according to the order of their first awaking ; and when the firm had finished there was no want of borrowers . each filled the tin dish at the water filter opposite the stove , and retired with the whole stock in trade to the platform of the car . there he knelt down , supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or one elbow crooked about the railing , and made a shift to wash his face and neck and hands ; a cold , an insufficient , and , if the train is moving rapidly , a somewhat dangerous toilet .Subject: double your life insurance at no extra cost ! 29155

from : moviebuff @ cliffhanger . com
subject : using pictures as links
i ' m changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages .
but , someone told me i should still put a ' click here ' underneath all the
pictures . to me , this removes all purpose of using the pictures .
how can i get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages
without coming right out and saying so ? for example , i have a page with
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days .

- - > i am currently living in a place where the isp is
blocking 50 % of
the web . i was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by
using a proxy , but i don ' t know what that means . i am wondering is
there a way to get access to these sites ? - -
a proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses , they can be tricky to setup yourself .
i have had very good results with surfola . basically you surf to their servers and then
from there you surf through / from their servers . i have several places i surf from that
block content . surfola easily bypasses them ! its also free ! you can also make money
with them but i just use them to bypass anal retentive isp / corporate providers and
because they allow me to surf anonymously !
i have a detailed right - up on them at http : / / linkpaks . com / paidtosurf / surfola . php

cj ,
two such sites that allows proxy surfing are :
http : / / www . anonymise . com and
http : / / www . anonymizer . com .
however , if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work .
also note , that if your isp is dictating to you which sites you may or
may not visit , then it is time to change providers !

~ ~ ~ ~
i reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and
i don ' t like mustard yellow for a background . also in the second or third
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be " first - come " not as
shown on the page .
i feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered
on the site . i will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter .
as has been mentioned many times , some information about the person
doing the page is always good . we need some information about
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to .
~ ~ ~ ~
dennis - i took a look at your site , and have recommendations
for improving your page .
1 - i use internet explorer and view web pages with my text size set to
' smaller ' . the text you used was quite large , like a font used for a heading
for all the text . by making the text size smaller it wouldn ' t feel like
you were screaming at me . also , the background was just too much .
2 - there were spelling errors in the text . often it might be difficult for you
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time , but have a friend
look it over . spelling errors make the page look unprofessional .
3 - offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like
before they subscribe . also , if you are asking for a person to give you
their email address , you must have a privacy policy and let them know
they can unsubscribe .
4 - think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter .
it looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to .
5 - offer information about yourself , and the kinds of information your
newsletter contains . maybe extend your site to include back issues or
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past .
6 - build another page for ' sponsoring info ' and put prices on that
page . remove all pricing information from the home page .
~ ~ ~ ~
i feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text .
i also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read
quickly , and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily .
i noticed some spelling errors , and i think that a link to the classifieds
site should be provided , and online payments should be accepted .
a site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it !
~ ~ ~ ~
this is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the
message . i did not like the background colour , however that is
personal , it did not detract from the information . i was tempted
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see
a current issue . there was an error in the wording ( a word
missed ) which needs correction and i think the fonts could be
smaller . overall a non - confusing site which makes a nice change . * cheers *
~ ~ ~ ~
could use a better background and the fonts are very large , there also
are errors in the following paragraphs :
" first com - first serve " and " to place a sponsor advertisement ,
send your to my email "
~ ~ ~ ~
a single page site . it is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster ' s
newsletter to see what he ' s doing , and it doesn ' t seem to me to be
a way to get people to visit . i wouldn ' t , for example . he claims to
have lots of tidbits of information that , he says , we probably
didn ' t know , and this is possible , but in my opinion , he would be
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for
all to see - when the appetite , so to speak , if he want people to
subscribe . as it is , i would not bother .
~ ~ ~ ~
what does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo ? some useful
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy
advertisement on the net . but what we get here is a newsletter
with the owner ( whose email reads damorgarjr @ yahoo . com )
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4 - line ad .
he also tells of paid category of advertisements . this is all we get
from a site which has a grand title . even the information about
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35 - to - 40
points size which gets difficult to read .
~ ~ ~ ~
a neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on
the eyes . there is only really one problem with this page - its
just an advertisement for a newsletter . no , scratch that , its an
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter . a bold enough
move perhaps but i learned hardly anything about the newsletter
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of
ads to my email account so i didn ' t even subscribe . presumably
you ' d want to get people to sign up so might i suggest splitting
the page into the newsletter itself , perhaps a sample issue ,
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click
for more info on your free ads .

it ' s true .
ask the ceos of yahoo . com and america online . they ' ll
tell you it ' s true . send an email to terry dean or allen
says or jim daniels and ask them about it . they ' ll agree
100 % that it ' s true . don ' t just take my word for it .
in fact , you can contact any of the 10 , 000 folks online
selling web marketing resources , and they will all tell you
emphatically , without question , no doubts whatsoever , that
it is absolutely true .
it ' s true . anyone can earn a living online . really , they
can . but , it takes several very important components to
join the 5 % who are successful on the web .
one of those necessities is a website .
now , your website does one of two things . . .
. . . it either makes the sale , or it doesn ' t .
for 95 % of online businesses , their websites simply do
not produce results .
and there is a very simple reason for poor performance .
poor sales letters .
does your website convince people to make a purchase ?
if not , here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter . . .
1 ) write your sales letter with an individual in mind .
go ahead and pick out someone , a real person to write your
sales letter to . doesn ' t matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat . write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally . why ?
because when your potential customer reads , it then it will
seem personal , almost like you wrote it with them in mind .
too often , sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person . keep your
sales letters personal , because one person at a time is
going to read them .
2 ) use an illustration to get your point across . in my
sales letters i have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running . i have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across montana on a grizzly bear . leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online . people love a good story that pounds home
a solid message . tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make . emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the " real world . " it effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point .
3 ) create an interest in the reader from the very first
line . your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more . go back to the beginning of this article . the first
words were , " it ' s true . " i can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought " what ' s true ? "
immediately , your mind wanted to know what i was talking
about . before you even knew it you were right here , 8
paragraphs into this article . carefully craft your first
line . if you can immediately get them wanting to know more ,
you ' ve got a winner .
4 ) use bullets . people spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists . in fact , they often reread them over and over . use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service , to spell out exactly what is included in your offer .
use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list .
5 ) launch into a bullet list immediately . shortly after
your opening line , immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb . hit them with your best shot .
pull out the big guns and stress " just a few of " the most
important things the reader will discover . by offering a
killer list early in your sales letter , you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy . after all , if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits , they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them .
6 ) just let it all flow out . write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter . you
can edit it later . if you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer , you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind . write it all down . then read
through it - you ' ll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points . edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas .
7 ) make your sales letter personal . make sure that the
words " you " and " your " are at least 4 : 1 over " i " and " my . "
your ad copy must be written about your customer not
yourself . i ' m not sure how the old advertising adage goes ,
but it ' s something like this , " i don ' t care a thing about
your lawn mower , i just care about my lawn . " leads aren ' t
interested in you or your products , they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs . when you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage , run a check at http : / / www . keywordcount . com and see
what the ratio between " you " and " your " versus references to
" i , " " me , " " my , " etc . it ' s a free service . make sure it ' s
at least 4 : 1 in favor of the customer .
8 ) write like you speak . forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you . write your sales letters
in everyday language , just like you would talk in person .
don ' t be afraid to begin sentences with " and " or " because . "
don ' t worry about ending a sentence with a preposition .
write like you speak . your sales letter isn ' t the great
american novel , so don ' t write it like you are ernest
hemingway .
9 ) use short paragraphs consisting of 2 - 4 sentences each .
long copy works . . . but long paragraphs do not . use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph . don ' t be
afraid to use short sentences . like this one .
or this .
see what i mean ? shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader . longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted .
10 ) stress the benefits , not the features . again ,
readers want the burning question answered , " what ' s in it
for me ? " what need is it going to meet ? what want is it
going to fill ? how is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader ? spell it out . don ' t
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader .
for example : if you are selling automobile tires , you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world ,
but who cares ? i don ' t care about your selection . but , i
do care about keeping my 3 - month - old baby girl safe while
we are traveling . so , instead of focusing on your selection ,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car . you ' re not
selling tires , you ' re selling safety for my family . stress
the benefits , not the features .
11 ) keep the reader interested . some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how i can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife . they are
filled with words and phrases that i need a dictionary to
understand . unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience , avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand . keep it simple , using words , language
and information that are easy to understand and follow .
12 ) target your sales letter . when you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter , target it to a
specific audience . for example : if you are selling a " work
at home " product , then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers . then , rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students . write another
letter targeting senior citizens . still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation . the possibilities are endless .
all you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience . " work only
5 hours a week , " would become " college students , work only
5 hours a week . " your sales letter is now targeted . upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
( you could easily target 100 ' s of groups ) .
then , simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums . you could advertise the " college students " page
in a campus ezine . the " senior citizens " page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board .
by creating these targeted sales letters , you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to . and , in their eyes , it looks like the product was a
match made for them .
13 ) make your ad copy easy to follow . use short sentences
and paragraphs . break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph . one
thing that i have always found to work very well in sales
letters . . .
. . . is to use a pause like this .
start the sentence on one line , leaving the reader wanting
to know more , and then finishing up on the next line . also ,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website , use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking . " let ' s
get you started down the road to success , shall we ? click
here to continue . "
14 ) use similes and metaphors for effect . when the
customer purchases your product , they will generate " a flood
of traffic that would make noah start building another ark . "
if they do not order today , then they will " feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away . " use words to create a picture
in the readers ' mind . when you think of superman , what
comes to mind ? immediately , we remember that he is " faster
than a speeding bullet . " " more powerful than a locomotive . "
" able to leap tall buildings in a single bound . " see how
word pictures stick in our minds ?
15 ) focus on one product or service . don ' t try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time . it only
confuses the reader . keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service . then , use other products and
services as back - end products .
16 ) make it stand out . don ' t kid yourself . there are
hundreds , maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing . how will you stand out among the
crowd ? your sales letter must inject personality . it must
breathe of originality . your product or service is
different . it ' s not like all of the rest . it is unique .
right ? your sales letter must separate you from the
competition . it must create a feeling of " you won ' t find
this anywhere else . "
17 ) be believable . " earn $ 54 , 000 in the next 24 hours ! ! ! "
delete . good grief , do they think i am an idiot or
something ? get real . don ' t make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth . you ' ll ruin your reputation .
let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed . once you have been branded a liar , you will
never be anything but a liar . it doesn ' t matter if you
launch the most respectable , honest business available
anywhere , people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you ' ve said before . be believable .
don ' t exaggerate , mislead , stretch or distort the truth .
18 ) be specific . don ' t generalize your information , but
rather be exact . instead of " over 100 tips for losing
weight " use " 124 tips for losing weight . " by generalizing
information , it creates doubt and questions in the reader ' s
mind . " what am i really getting here ? does he even know ? "
when you use specific information , the reader begins to
think , " this person must have counted . i know exactly what
i can expect . " " platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck , " wrote claude
hopkins in his classic book " scientific advertising . " " they
leave no impression whatsoever . "
19 ) be complete . tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service . answer all of
their questions , anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase . think about it from their point of view .
ask yourself , " why wouldn ' t i buy this ? " then , address that
in your sales letter . remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase .
20 ) use testimonials to boost your sales . share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service . many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed . satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader . " if these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product , then i
probably will too . " especially effective are testimonials
from respected , well known " authorities " within your target
field .
21 ) use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter .
a headline isn ' t just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy . use them frequently - but don ' t overuse . a well -
placed headline re - grabs the reader ' s attention , brings
them deeper into the letter , and readies them for the next
paragraph . you will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter . they are
that important .
22 ) avoid asking stupid questions . " wouldn ' t you like to
make $ 1 , 000 , 000 a year ? " " doesn ' t that sound great ? " " would
you like to be as successful as i am ? " avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior .
23 ) offer a freebie even if the customer doesn ' t buy .
if the customer decides he or she isn ' t going to make a
purchase , then you want to follow - up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future . by offering a free
item , you can request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie . by doing this , you can now follow - up
with the customer for a potential future sale .
additionally , you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy , banners , flyers , etc . within the free item .
and , of course , if your free item is a high quality , useful
product or service which impresses the customer , they
probably will be back as a customer soon .
24 ) use bonuses to overwhelm the reader . one of the things
that i have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that out - value the actual product
i am offering . ginsu made this one famous . they were
selling a set of steak knives , but before the commercial
was finished , you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse . make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless , outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer .
25 ) use connective phrases like " but wait , there ' s more "
and " but that ' s not all . " these phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next , particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits , or
leads into bonus items . again , the idea is more and more
value and benefits to the reader .
26 ) always include a deadline . by including a deadline ,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer .
" if i don ' t order within 24 hours , then i won ' t get the
bonuses . " " oh no , there are only 10 items remaining ,
i ' ve got to hurry . " let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don ' t make the deadline . remember ,
they won ' t miss out on your products or bonuses , they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products . deadlines
are very effective . every sales letter should have one .
27 ) tell them exactly how to order . be clear as to the
order process . point them towards the order link . tell
them what methods you offer . ( i . e . credit cards , checks ,
etc . ) make this process as simple and clear as can be .
if it takes more than 2 steps , most people won ' t continue .
28 ) explain when the product will be delivered . how
quickly will the order be processed ? when will the order be
available ? let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order . the more specific you
can be here , the better . let them know that you have a
system in place . " operators are standing by . " their order
will be handled properly . tell them .
29 ) offer a money back guarantee . take away their last
reason to hold back . offer a " no questions asked " 30 day
guarantee . most people may not realize this , but in most
cases , it ' s the law of the land . you are required to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service . since it ' s the law anyway , why not make
it a benefit . let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service risk - free .
30 ) instruct them to respond immediately . many people
just need to read those words , " act now ! " " order today ! "
" click here to instantly place your order . " you ' ve got them
this far , now tell them what you want them to do . get them
to " act fast ! " have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn ' t prompt the viewer to order right
way ?
31 ) include a post script . people will always read the
p . s . always . in fact , the p . s . is one of the most important
parts of your sales letter . why ? because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost . a
p . s . is a perfect place to recap your offer , so when they
see your price tag , they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money . use
your p . s . to restate your offer in detail .
32 ) include a second post script . you better believe
if they read the first p . s . , they will read a p . p . s . use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order . i guarantee you they will read it .
use these 32 tips and i guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters . in fact , it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve .

while the couple were apparently examining the strange device , rob
started to his feet and walked toward them
the crowd fell back at his approach , but the man and the girl were so
interested that they did not notice himhe was still several paces away when
the girl put out her finger and touched the indicator on the dial
discontinue orange stad , and then mail stop 1 . 200 b , followed by a rub
a
to rob ' s horror and consternation the big turk began to rise slowly into
the air , while a howl of fear burst from the crowdbut the boy made a mighty
spring and caught the turk by his foot , clinging to it with desperate
tenacity , while they both mounted steadily upward until they were far above

internet success through simplicity
= - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =
every day of the week , i get questions from people all
over the world , including my no bs gimg members ,
wanting to know some of the most valuable " secrets "
to my on - going internet success .
let me say , above all else , i don ' t believe there are any
* true * " secrets " to success on the net . what you do to
become successful in the online world is not a " secret " ,
in my opinion . most successful people follow simple , clear ,
repeatedly - proven strategies to succeed , whether on the
net or off .
but , when it comes to someone asking for advice ,
consultation , or simply asking , " what ' s your secret ? " ,
i have to blush & say . . .
persistence and personality .
of course , i always follow the advice with my own little
disclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the
same for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over
the deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind , in
my opinion - is somehow an unknown , unattainable secret .
clearly , it is not . it ' s not unknown . it ' s not unattainable .
it ' s not years of digging to find the " secrets " to internet riches .
one thing that " gets to me " so often in my work as an
internet consultant , author and internet success
strategist is that so many people on the net seem to
have this incredibly huge mental block that stands
between themselves and success on the net . it ' s
almost as if they ' ve been barraged by so many claims
of what works and what doesn ' t work , and so many
long , complicated routes to actually succeeding in
their online venture , that " success " is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall .
it ' s not that difficult , my friends ! it is not that complicated ! !
long - time friend and business associate rick beneteau
has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking
the bank . get it ! !
http : / / www . roibot . com / bybb . cgi ? im 7517 _ bybtb .
but , the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks
so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your
online venture a success .
and , yes , rick & i come from the same school of
" self marketing " - marketing you ! obviously , that ' s
the core of his excellent new ebook , and i couldn ' t
agree with him more .
point being , * you * are everything you do online to
succeed . you are your web site , your business , your
marketing piece , your customer service , your customers '
experiences with your business - - all of it , is you !
read his ebook & you ' ll see more of what i ' m saying .
the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have
standing high as you can see , blocking the path
between you & internet success . listen to me - it is
not real ok ? it doesn ' t exist . there ' s nothing there
to fear to begin with . . . get over it ! !
what i ' m telling you is , the only thing standing between
you and the success you most desire . . . is yourself .
when you realize this , you will tear down that brick
wall by means of complete and instantaneous
disintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * ,
which is the only " real " place it ever was anyhow !
yes , " persistence and personality " inherently includes
honesty , integrity , accountability , and many other
qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate
goals and realize that probably the most valuable ,
powerful key to your success . . . is you !
that may be the most incredible " secret " we ever
uncover in our lifetime ! and , trust me , that brick wall
won ' t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it .
talk about simple ! !

our web site is initially designed to get leads , build
branding , and provide information . . . . . . . with a 12 month goal
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart .
we offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments
via our site .
our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in
traditional media and by referral for more information , and
to make a professional impression on someone you may not
meet before providing service .
the growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown
outside of anyone ' s expectations . . . . . . . certainly mine and
i ' ve been in this business for 25 years . the internet is not
dead in the horse business , it is just getting it ' s legs , and
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services
on - line as well . our site ( the first we ' ve developed ) has
exceeded our expectations , and we aren ' t satisfied with it

in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately , with a deposit agreement and
cash receipt he made with a security company in
abidjan cote d ' ivoire where he deposited one iron box
containing usd $ 22 million dollars cash ( twenty two
million dollars ) .
this money was made from the sell of gold and diamond
by my father and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest .

father . also , i have been granted political stay as a
refugee by the government of côte d ' ivoire .

based on this , i solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your account , but i will

dear partner ,
we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate .
at the moment , we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies , which we intend to transfer to your account , upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you . based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity , loyalty and understanding , we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly . all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative , as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit , that will turn around profit favourably . we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture , and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with . also
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $ 13 , 731 , 000 , 00 usd ( thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars ) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover , please it should be within the set aside capital . in this regard , the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding ; with special emphasis on the following :
1 . the tax obligationin your country
2 . the initial capital base required in your proposed
investment area , as well as ;
3 . the legal technicalities in setting up a
business in your country with foreigners as share - holders
4 . the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement .
5 . your ability to provide a beneficiary / partnership account with a minimal deposit , where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently .
another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on , is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing . since we are the owners of the funds , and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country , we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring
such huge amount of funds , without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds ; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations . remember that , on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds . you will be the one to be doing all these , and in the course of transfer , if for any reason whatsoever , you incurred some bills , we shall adequately retire same , upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account . the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen , and to trust your personality and status , especially as it concerns the security of the
funds in your custody .
i await your response ,
sincerely ,
john adams

i truely solicite your assistance for a business proposal .
dear friend ,
it is my absolute confidence to ensure this urgent and important businees proposal with you . i am greatly optimistic to forward you this note , as regards your assistance to enable me execute a venture of mutual benefit with you .
my name is mr daniel mutade , a senior employee with the central bank of zimbabwe . during the last national election held by president robert mugabe , i and my colleagues worked out twenty million united states dollars ( us $ 20 m ) as over - invoiced and inflated payment for election materials and the fund is now deposited with a security company in europe for safe keeping . we are not sure of the future of our country zimbabwe , due to the cry of more sanctions by world leaders in and around the world as a result of the brutal take over of white farmers land and residents in zimbabwe by the mugabe ' s administration .
my colleagues and i are now seeking to secure and invest this funds wisely abroad . i am currently in europe on a short visit and my involvement in this transaction shall be kept secret , since our civil service code of conduct forbids us to have any private account and financial dealings of this magnitude . for this reason , we need the assistance of a foreign company or person to push this money into their / his account .
your share of assisting us successfully put intoyour account this moneywill be 26 % of the total sum , while 70 % will be for us ( my colleagues and i ) and 4 % has been mapped out for any expenses that may be incured by both parties during the cause of transferring the funds into your nominated bank account .
i will refrain from giving out more operational details until i urgentlyreceive your reply of interest , since time is of the essence in this transaction . however , i need to inform you that this transaction is 100 % risk free because we have done our homework carefully to ensure the smoothness and realization of this transaction .
please if you consider this business necessary , do reply me as soon as possible for more details , as this transaction will usher us into a greater benefits within a shortest possible time . could you please send your reply to dmutade @ mail 2 dave . com please do include your telephone and fax numbers when replying to this business proposal .

every day of the week , i get questions from people all
over the world , including my no bs gimg members ,
wanting to know some of the most valuable " secrets "
to my on - going internet success .
let me say , above all else , i don ' t believe there are any
* true * " secrets " to success on the net . what you do to
become successful in the online world is not a " secret " ,
in my opinion . most successful people follow simple , clear ,
repeatedly - proven strategies to succeed , whether on the
net or off .
but , when it comes to someone asking for advice ,
consultation , or simply asking , " what ' s your secret ? " ,
i have to blush & say . . .
persistence and personality .
of course , i always follow the advice with my own little
disclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the
same for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over
the deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind , in
my opinion - is somehow an unknown , unattainable secret .
clearly , it is not . it ' s not unknown . it ' s not unattainable .
it ' s not years of digging to find the " secrets " to internet riches .
one thing that " gets to me " so often in my work as an
internet consultant , author and internet success
strategist is that so many people on the net seem to
have this incredibly huge mental block that stands
between themselves and success on the net . it ' s
almost as if they ' ve been barraged by so many claims
of what works and what doesn ' t work , and so many
long , complicated routes to actually succeeding in
their online venture , that " success " is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall .
it ' s not that difficult , my friends ! it is not that complicated ! !
long - time friend and business associate rick beneteau
has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking
the bank . get it ! !
http : / / www . roibot . com / bybb . cgi ? im 7517 _ bybtb .
but , the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks
so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your
online venture a success .
and , yes , rick & i come from the same school of
" self marketing " - marketing you ! obviously , that ' s
the core of his excellent new ebook , and i couldn ' t
agree with him more .
point being , * you * are everything you do online to
succeed . you are your web site , your business , your
marketing piece , your customer service , your customers '
experiences with your business - - all of it , is you !
read his ebook & you ' ll see more of what i ' m saying .
the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have
standing high as you can see , blocking the path
between you & internet success . listen to me - it is
not real ok ? it doesn ' t exist . there ' s nothing there
to fear to begin with . . . get over it ! !
what i ' m telling you is , the only thing standing between
you and the success you most desire . . . is yourself .
when you realize this , you will tear down that brick
wall by means of complete and instantaneous
disintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * ,
which is the only " real " place it ever was anyhow !
yes , " persistence and personality " inherently includes
honesty , integrity , accountability , and many other
qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate
goals and realize that probably the most valuable ,
powerful key to your success . . . is you !
that may be the most incredible " secret " we ever
uncover in our lifetime ! and , trust me , that brick wall
won ' t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it .
talk about simple ! !

branding , and provide information . . . . . . . with a 12 month goal
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart .
we offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments
via our site .
our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in
traditional media and by referral for more information , and
to make a professional impression on someone you may not
meet before providing service .
the growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown
outside of anyone ' s expectations . . . . . . . certainly mine and
i ' ve been in this business for 25 years . the internet is not
dead in the horse business , it is just getting it ' s legs , and

5 ways to create a unique website
= - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =
internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design . this is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites . these
five points will help you come up with a one - of - a - kind design
for your website .
1 . navigation system
deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website . visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else . i would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas . look at webmasterbase
( http : / / www . webmasterbase . com ) for example . there is a list
of categories on the left , and information about the network
on the top bar .
it is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because :
- people see the top of the page first
- if you have a lot of content on one page , the navigation gets
pushed to bottom of the page . . . away from the visitor .
2 . color scheme
when you are choosing colors , make sure they contrast . for
example , do not use bright green and florescent pink . some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white .
a wonderful utility that is web - based and free is color schemer
( http : / / www . godigitalstudios . com / www / color / ) , created by aaron
epstein . many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors . try doing a search on freewarefiles
( http : / / www . freewarefiles . com ) , tucows ( http : / / www . tucows . com ) ,
or download . com ( http : / / www . download . com ) for " color schemer . "
3 . content window
this is the brain of the website . make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand .
also , provide your own original content . people do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say . they want to hear what
you want to say ! while it might be time consuming to write
your own content , it sure is worth it .
to find content for your website , try searching at
ezinearticles ( http : / / www . ezinearticles . com ) . other people may
have used the articles , but if you become good friends with the
authors , they may send you new content as they write it . be
careful though . do not use too much content from other
authors , as mentioned above .
4 . font ( s )
several types of fonts exist . the first one i will discuss is
fixed width or monospace , similar to courier or courier new .
fixed width fonts are good for displaying code ( like html . )
another type of font is called sans serif . it is similar to
arial ( windows ) or helvetica ( macintosh ) . this font can be
used for long pieces of text .
the final type of font is called serif because it has serifs ,
or curves , in each letter . often , this font is called times
( windows ) or georgia ( macintosh ) . this font , like sans serif ,
is often used for long blocks of text . it is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter , making it
easier to read .
5 . advertising
ah , everybody ' s favorite . . . advertising ! this is one of thing
that almost every website has . the most common type is what
is known as " banner " advertising . it is called that because it is
long and thin ( like a paper banner . ) how long you ask ? the
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high .
new sizes however are being used . take for example the new
style called " skyscraper " - - so called for a reason : it looks
like a skyscraper . it is tall ( about 425 pixels ) but not too
wide ( about 100 - 125 pixels . )
finding a way to place advertising can be tricky . banners
used to be placed ( and still are ) only at the top of the page .
nevertheless , banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page , at the bottom , or along the side .
conclusion
these are only five things to consider when designing a
website . there are many others however . let me know what
you find that helps you create a unique website . my email

Subject: [ ilug ] we need your assistance to invest in your country
dear sir / madam ,
i am well confident of your capability to assist me in
a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties , ie
( me and you ) i am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence i am about
to establish with you . i have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect .
well , i am victor sankoh , son to mr . foday
sankoh
who was arrested by the ecomog peace keeping force
months ago in my country sierra leone .
few days before the arrest of my father , he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately , with a deposit agreement and
cash receipt he made with a security company in
abidjan cote d ' ivoire where he deposited one iron box
containing usd $ 22 million dollars cash ( twenty two
million dollars ) .
this money was made from the sell of gold and diamond
by my father and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest .
thereafter , i rushed down to abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father . also , i have been granted political stay as a
refugee by the government of côte d ' ivoire .
meanwhile , my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from côte d ' ivoire immediately for investment .
based on this , i solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your account , but i will
demand for the following requirement :
( 1 ) could you provide for me a safe bank account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money ?
( 2 ) could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money ?
( 3 ) could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested ?
please , all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence i will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter . i am a
christian and i will please , want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust i have established
on you .
for your assistance in this transaction , i have
decided to offer you 12 % percent commission of the
total amount at the end of this business . the security
of this business is very important to me and as such ,
i would like you to keep this business very
confidential . i shall be expecting your urgent reply .
thank you and god bless you .

last weeks ' s survey results paid the fees ;
and , promptly assigned my www . schoolofgeomatics . com
address to a porn shop . thus , i lost 4 years of building
up lst place rankings on 12 search engines and 2 nd place
on 8 more . this set me back about 4 months : i believe i
lost a minimum of $ 50 , 000 .
i have also been hit with viruses about 10 times . the first
time i lost almost 4 months of work . now , i back up often
enough to not to lose so much time . this is also internet
theft . these people are nothing but out and out criminals
and should spend years behind bars .
customers are well protected from credit card theft ;
however , merchants can lose a lot of money . i sell only by
purchase order and certified or registered company checks .

Subject: legal advice
* this message was transferred with a trial version of communigate ( tm ) pro *
we all
need a good attorney to call in today ' s society .
keeping ahead of the legal issues in our life was just simply more than we could
bear . we needed legal advice and we needed it right away . unfortunately , being middle class , put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity . now all of this has changed .
think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life :
monday : the dog bit the mailman - do you know what to do ?
tuesday : the building inspector drops by and announces that the permits on file with their office do not
allow your garage conversion . " what now , " you think to yourself .
wednesday : you ' ve been considering home - schooling your children for some time . now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again , and simply will not attend another day . what are the legal ramifications of home schooling your children ?
thursday : speeding ticket goes to warrant for your 17 - year - old son . you haven ' t a clue how to handle
it .
friday : your ex - spouse has missed another child support payment . . . who do you call ?
and what about all the other things :
received a traffic ticket you thought was unjustified ?
paid a bill you knew was unfair ?
lost a security deposit ?
bought a home or purchased a car ?
signed an employment contract ?
had difficulty collecting an insurance claim ?
had trouble with your credit report ?
been involved in a landlord or property dispute ?
been involved in a separation or divorce ?
had to collect child support ?
prepared a will or wanted to ?
in your personal life , you need legal representation available to you all the time . but most of us never have it because we can ' t afford it .
now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help ,
but it provides it 24 hours a day , with an attorney helping you the same day you call them -
and it is for a small monthly fee . no kidding . somewhere between twenty and forty dollars a month , depending upon the plan you choose .
